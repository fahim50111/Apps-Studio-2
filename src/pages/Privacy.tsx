        <Section title="Introduction">Apps Studio ("we", "us", or "our") respects your privacy. This policy explains what limited information we handle when you use our website and how we protect it. By using Apps Studio, you agree to the practices described here.</Section>
        <Section title="Information We Collect">
          Apps Studio does not require you to create an account, and we do not ask for personal information such as your name, email or phone number to browse or download. The limited data we handle includes:
          <ul className="mt-3 space-y-2">
            <Bullet><b className="text-fg">App requests:</b> if you voluntarily submit a request, we store the app name and any note you provide.</Bullet>
            <Bullet><b className="text-fg">Local preferences:</b> your theme choice and notification "seen" markers are stored only in your browser's local storage — never on our servers.</Bullet>
            <Bullet><b className="text-fg">Anonymous usage counts:</b> we increment a download counter per app. This is not linked to you.</Bullet>
          </ul>
        </Section>
        <Section title="How We Use Information">We use the limited data solely to operate and improve the service — for example to show popular apps, process your requests, and remember your theme preference on this device.</Section>
        <Section title="Cookies & Local Storage">We do not use tracking cookies. Local storage is used only for theme preference and notification state on your device.</Section>
        <Section title="Notifications">If you allow browser notifications, we may alert you when new apps are added. You can revoke this permission at any time from your browser settings. Notifications are optional and disabled by default.</Section>
        <Section title="Third-Party Links">Downloads are delivered through third-party hosts (such as file-sharing services). When you follow a download link you leave Apps Studio and become subject to that provider's own privacy policy. We are not responsible for the content or practices of third-party sites.</Section>
        <Section title="Data Security">We rely on Google Firebase infrastructure with strict access rules. Public visitors can only read the catalog, increment download counts, and submit size-limited requests. All other database operations are restricted.</Section>
        <Section title="Children's Privacy">Apps Studio is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from them.</Section>
        <Section title="Changes to This Policy">We may update this policy from time to time. Changes take effect when posted on this page, and the "Last updated" date will be revised accordingly.</Section>
        <Section title="Contact">If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, contact us at <span className="select-all font-semibold text-fg">{CONTACT_EMAIL}</span>.</Section>
